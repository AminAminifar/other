Please run Main.ipynp (Main.py is the .py file of Main.ipynp)

for runing the code "handwritten_digits_images.csv" and "handwritten_digits_labels.csv" files
must be in the same directory.




More information:
KNN_select() and preprocess_data() are defined in the code but not used in the final version.
Since KNN was very slow and reducing the dimensionality by preprocess_data() degraded the 
classification performance, I did not use them.
